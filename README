Nora Tucker - Lab 13 - Snake Game

This game is basically a typical snake game. Controls are the up, down, left
and right arrows on the keyboard. You can also set the speed of the snake 
by clicking e (easy), m (medium), or h (hard). The default speed is medium.
Additionally, there is a pause feature. You click p to pause, and then play
is resumed when you click an arrow key (direction is switched to that 
direction), or when p is clicked again (movement continues in the same
direction).

You lose when you hit the edge (blue) or yourself (green), either by hitting
a tail piece or changing direction into yourself (from up to down, left to 
right, or vice versa). When you lose, a screen is temporarily displayed 
that tells you that you lost, and what the size of your snake was. You can
also quit by clicking q at any time.
